# Week 2 - Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis

We will use the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) framework as a way to begin working with R. A key component of EDA is visualizing data. Topics covered will include:

-   Understanding packages and how to download, manage, and maintain themÂ 

-   Understanding the Exploratory Data Analysis lifecycle

-   Importing data into R from Excel files and .csvs

-   Visualizing data using `ggplot2`

-   Sharing code using git and Github
